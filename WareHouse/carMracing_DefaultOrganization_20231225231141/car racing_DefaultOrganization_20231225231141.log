<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `math` module is not imported in the `main.py` file, but it is being used in the `Car` class in the `car.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `math` module in the `main.py` file.

In the `main.py` file, add the following line at the top, after the existing import statements:

```python
import math
```

This will ensure that the `math` module is available for use in the `Car` class.

Once you make this change, the code should work as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `math` module is not imported in the `main.py` file, but it is being used in the `Car` class in the `car.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `math` module in the `main.py` file.

In the `main.py` file, add the following line at the top, after the existing import statements:

```python
import math
```

This will ensure that the `math` module is available for use in the `Car` class.

Once you make this change, the code should work as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Car` class is missing the implementation of the `accelerate`, `decelerate`, `turn_left`, and `turn_right` methods. These methods are mentioned in the `main.py` file but are not implemented in the `Car` class.

To fix this, you need to add the implementation for these methods in the `Car` class in the `car.py` file. Here's an example of how you can implement these methods:

```python
def accelerate(self, acceleration):
    # Increase the car's speed
    self.speed += acceleration

def decelerate(self, deceleration):
    # Decrease the car's speed
    self.speed -= deceleration

def turn_left(self, angle):
    # Rotate the car to the left
    self.angle += angle

def turn_right(self, angle):
    # Rotate the car to the right
    self.angle -= angle
```

Make sure to add these methods with the correct indentation and update the `main.py` file to call these methods appropriately.

Once you have implemented these methods, the `Car` class will have all the necessary functionality to accelerate, decelerate, and turn the car in the game.

Please make these changes and let me know if you need any further assistance.

2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Mario Cart style car racing game in 2D.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Car` class is missing the implementation of the `accelerate`, `decelerate`, `turn_left`, and `turn_right` methods. These methods are mentioned in the `main.py` file but are not implemented in the `Car` class.

To fix this, you need to add the implementation for these methods in the `Car` class in the `car.py` file. Here's an example of how you can implement these methods:

```python
def accelerate(self, acceleration):
    # Increase the car's speed
    self.speed += acceleration

def decelerate(self, deceleration):
    # Decrease the car's speed
    self.speed -= deceleration

def turn_left(self, angle):
    # Rotate the car to the left
    self.angle += angle

def turn_right(self, angle):
    # Rotate the car to the right
    self.angle -= angle
```

Make sure to add these methods to the `Car` class in the `car.py` file. Once you've made these changes, the `accelerate`, `decelerate`, `turn_left`, and `turn_right` methods will be available for use in the `main.py` file.

Please make these changes and let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the Mario Cart style car racing game project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file. In this case, the project requires the pygame package. Here's an example of how the requirements.txt file should look like:
requirements.txt
```
pygame==2.0.1
```
This file specifies that the project requires pygame version 2.0.1. You can create this file and include it in the project directory. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Chief Executive Officer: Thank you for providing the solution for the requirements.txt file. It correctly specifies the dependency on the pygame package with the required version.

As the Chief Executive Officer, I would like to add a few more instructions to enhance the Mario Cart style car racing game:

1. Implement player controls: Allow the player to control the car using keyboard inputs. The arrow keys can be used to accelerate, decelerate, and turn the car left or right.

2. Add AI-controlled cars: Introduce AI-controlled cars that move around the track. These cars should follow a predefined path and avoid collisions with other cars and track boundaries.

3. Implement collision detection: Detect collisions between the player's car, AI-controlled cars, and track boundaries. When a collision occurs, the game should respond accordingly, such as reducing the car's speed or ending the game.

4. Add power-ups: Introduce power-ups on the track that the player can collect to gain advantages, such as temporary speed boosts or invincibility.

5. Implement a scoring system: Create a scoring system that tracks the player's performance, such as lap times, number of power-ups collected, and collisions avoided. Display the score on the screen during gameplay.

6. Design multiple tracks: Create multiple tracks with varying difficulty levels and visual themes. Allow the player to choose a track before starting the game.

7. Add sound effects and background music: Enhance the gaming experience by adding sound effects for car movements, collisions, and power-up collection. Include background music that complements the game's theme.

Please provide a detailed plan on how you will implement these instructions and any additional resources or assistance you may require.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
